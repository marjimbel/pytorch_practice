    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to use pre-trained networks to solved challenging problems in computer vision. Specifically, you'll use networks trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) [available from torchvision](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/torchvision/models.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "ImageNet is a massive dataset with over 1 million labeled images in 1000 categories. It's used to train deep neural networks using an architecture called convolutional layers. I'm not going to get into the details of convolutional networks here, but if you want to learn more about them, please [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ol7ZB0MmU).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, these models work astonishingly well as feature detectors for images they weren't trained on. Using a pre-trained network on images not in the training set is called transfer learning. Here we'll use transfer learning to train a network that can classify our cat and dog photos with near perfect accuracy.\n",

The features part is a stack of convolutional layers and overall works as a feature detector that can be fed into a classifier. The classifier part is a single fully-connected layer `(classifier): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=1000)`. This layer was trained on the ImageNet dataset, so it won't work for our specific problem. That means we need to replace the classifier, but the features will work perfectly on their own. In general, I think about pre-trained networks as amazingly good feature detectors that can be used as the input for simple feed-forward classifiers."

You can move them back from the GPU with `model.to('cpu')` which you'll commonly do when you need to operate on the network output outside of PyTorch. As a demonstration of the increased speed, I'll compare how long it takes to perform a forward and backward pass with and without a GPU."
